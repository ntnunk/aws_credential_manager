# AWS Credential Manager

A small utility application useful for managing [Amazon Web
Services](https://aws.amazon.com) credentials in a multi-account AWS environment
accessed via Single Sign-On (SSO).

## Background

I'm not sure how SSO is handled with AWS in other organizations but
in the environment I work in, upon signing in to AWS via SSO we're presented
with a list of available AWS accounts and, for each role in the account, the
option to open the AWS management console or obtain time-limited credentials for
programmatic access, in the form of a standard AWS Access Key ID and Secret
Access Key, along with a Session Token. These credentials are presented in
various ways to make it easier to use them directly in a shell via environment
variables, copy directly to a standard .aws/credentials file, or past into code.

I found it useful, when working in multiple accounts simultaneously or switching
between accounts frequently, to keep a standard set of account names in my
.aws/credentials file and simply update those standard accounts in my
credentials file with a current set of credentials. This makes it far easier to
remember what value to use for a --profile argument while using AWS CLI or SAM
commands as I can use, for example --profile sandbox instead of the name
generated by the SSO console, which would be far less user-friendly.
